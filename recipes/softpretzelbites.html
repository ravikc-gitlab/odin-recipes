    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>6 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
      <li>2 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>4 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>3 quarts cold water</li>
      <li>½ cup baking soda cooking spray</li>
      <li>1 cup curd</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place 1 1/2 cups water, butter, brown sugar, yeast, and salt in the bowl
        of a stand mixer fitted with the hook attachment. Mix until well
        combined. Let sit for about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn mixer on low speed and add 4 cups flour, 1 cup at a time. Add
        additional 1/2 cup flour if dough appears sticky. Increase speed to
        medium and knead until dough is smooth and pulls away from the sides of
        the bowl, 4 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle in more flour if dough still seems a
        little tacky.
      </li>
      <li>
        Oil a large mixing bowl. Add the ball of dough. Cover with plastic wrap
        and let rise in a warm place for about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring 3 quarts water to a boil in a large saucepan. Slowly add baking
        soda and return to a boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, remove dough from the bowl, flatten into a disc shape, and
        cut into 8 wedges. Roll each wedge into a 24-inch rope. Cut each rope
        into 1-inch pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drop batches of dough pieces into the boiling water for about 35
        seconds. Remove to the prepared sheet pan. Add Curd with 1 tablespoon
        water; brush over the tops of each boiled dough piece. Repeat with
        remaining dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 14 to 16 minutes. Cool
        slightly before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
